# XML Parser  
  
A Flutter project to parse **.xml files**. By this application you can see two samples of parsing and also you're be able to choose a directory from your device and parse subset .xml files into a **.txt file**.
  
## Getting Started

### Home Page
As the first page you see the **home page** includes two buttons, **Sample Button** to see the sample inputs and see and the **Browse Button** to choose your directory from device and parse it 


### Sample Page
In this page you can choose English or Italian inputs sample to see the parsed text. In fact I have saved the .xml files in our assets folder and parse them.
